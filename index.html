        <h1>Classes of D&D (A Guide For Non-Players)</h1>
        <p> In the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons, there are twelve classes.  Although they are obviously intened for the game, these classes can also exemplify
            many of the classic archetypes we find in our favorite stories.  Use this guide to help identify certain personalities and see if your favorite characters
            fit any of the roles below!

            <h2>Barbarians</h2>
            <p>
                The Barbarian seems to have a natural advantage in battle, to the point of often not even wearing armor.  They charge head-first into the most dangerous situations 
                with zero fear of the consequences.  Their tendency is to be a somewhat irrationa, emotional character, using channeled anger and intimidation to overcome obstacles.
                They can be inspiring and even funny, though usually by accident alone.  There's no denying this character's natural bloodlust and will excel in action-based adventures.
            </p>

        <article id = "bard" >
            <h2>Bards</h2>
            <p>
                Bards are the artists of the world.  Their role is best served as inspiration and support to those around them.  They are the embodiment of charisma and use this 
                talent as much as they can.  Using their artistry of music and other forms, they can charm and inspire others to great lengths. Sadly bards can be hard to find in modern works as their role of narrator and support can be hard to describe.  But in certain worlds they 
                provide a unique type of character that is addictively charming. 
            </p>

        <article id = "cleric" >
            <h2>Clerics</h2>
            <p>
                The most defining aspect of a Cleric is their devotion to a god or deity.  This defines the Cleric moreso than any act such as healing or protection.  Although
                most Clerics would consider themselves good or holy, there are gods in many worlds that are evil.  This character is usually a noble person 
                by nature, but this does not mean they shy from action or fighting.  They can vary from a priest role to a crusader role and thus are fun characters
                to add to a story.

        <article id = "druid">
            <h2>Druids</h2>
            <p>A druid is a nature lover through and through.  A great character to represent balance and growth, druids make great additions to any story
                that involves nature or the forest.  An added ability in druidic lore is their ability to shapeshift. They can be seemingly antisocial and
                can often be a great support character or source of inspiration and direction to another role.
            </p>

        </article>
        <article id = "fighter">
            <h2>Fighters</h2>
            <p>A fighter is a specialist in combat of the purest sense.  There is no style, no form, no weapon, no situation that is unfamiliar to the fully- 
                trained fighter.  They are admittedly one-dimensional, but where they excel are often the most exciting and climactic parts of a story so they 
                make naturally great lead characters.
            </p>

        <article id = "monk">
            <h2>Monks</h2>
            <p>A monk is in the truest sense a person from a monastery.  This gives the character a deep spiritual background.  Depending on their religion,
                monks can have different abilities, though these are often managed by some sort of internal power or balance they have cultivated in their 
                monastic studies.  Their role can take on many forms and can a monk character can add a lot to many stories.  They can offer a calming presence 
                to an otherwise rowdy team, or just offer a source of wisdom or a unique kind of action only they can offer.
            </p>

        <article id = "paladin">
            <h2>Paladins</h2>
            <p>Paladins are sworn to an oath.  This oath can take many forms, but it defines them no matter what it is.  Traditionally paladins are virtuous
                and are found as the "good guy" in many stories as sherriffs, Jedi, or other groups bound to codes.  Although the character often provides a 
                heroic dynamic to a story this doesn't have to be the case and can be fun to experiment with.  Ultimately the character is defined by their 
                beliefs which can cause interesting conflicts and stories.  They make a great addition to a lot of stories, and make a great main character
                for a lot of different ideas.
            </p>

        <article id = "ranger">
            <h2>Rangers</h2>
            <p>A natural huntsman and woodsman.  Although equally at home in nature as the Druid, the Ranger adopts a different mindset, using intelligence and
                more human elements to tame nature.  They often play the role of a "lone wolf" but can be useful in a party especially as a scout.  Survival
                is paramount to the Ranger and they are not usually loud or extravagant.  They have also been known to command animals as pets.
            </p>

        </article>
        <article id = "rogue">
            <h2>Rogues</h2>
            <p>A rogue by definition is their own person.  They are the characters who know how to pick locks, sneak around, create traps and other 
                skills that people do not have the highest opinion of.  In addition to this they are known for their dexterity and accuracy moreso than raw 
                power, and will often be nimble or even acrobatic.  They are great for stories looking for a little "dark side" or if you need someone in a 
                story who can do the things other characters wouldn't do naturally.
            </p>

        </article>
        <article id = "sorcerer">
            <h2>Sorcerers</h2>
            <p>Sorcerers are users of magic.  Although some magic users must study spells to become great, the sorcerer is a natural, being able to feel 
                spells over learning them.  This has its pros and cons, as what they lack in discipline they can overcome with intuition.  Often the 
                sorcerer in a story is a main character, and the methods they use to obtain their spells can be part of their story.  They are a great addition
                to almost any party, and the mystery of their class lends them to great character development.
            </p>

        </article>
        <article id = "warlock">
            <h2>Warlocks</h2>
            <p>Warlocks are the symbolic counter to the holy cleric.  Though both classes draw their powers from deities, the relationship the Warlock has
                with their god is usually not as "voluntary" as that of others.  As a part of their identity, they must answer to a higher power who
                will occasionally summon them to do their bidding.  Although the idea of being one may not fill someone with joy, these limitations can provide
                a story with a lot of built-in conflicts that can be elaborated upon.
            </p>
            <img src="warlock.jpg" alt="A Human Warlock" width=40% class="styleright">
        </article>
        <article id = "wizard">
            <h2>Wizards</h2>
            <p>Another user of magic, but not one who is inherently skilled in it.  The wizard is a person who has spent thousands of hours collecting,
                reading, and perfecting magic spells to use.  Although they may need an inherent magic ability to start with, the progress of their skills
                are often defined by how good of a student they are over any inherent powers.  This allows for many exciting adventures and stories on 
                the Wizard's way to being one of the greats.
